Tutor should not be able to schedule him or herself for a session unless it has been opened by the tutor who is scheduled

When a schedule is opened, an email will be sent to superadmins, admins and all tutors (future iteration will have subject specific tutors e.g. stats tutors in math lab).

Once someone has accepted the session, an email will be sent to the original schedulee, admins and the new tutor.
